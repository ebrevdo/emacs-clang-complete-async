* Introduction

emacs-clang-complete-async is an emacs extension to complete C and C++ code, 
it uses libclang to parse the source code on the fly and provides completion candidates to
auto-complete (http://cx4a.org/software/auto-complete).

[[https://github.com/Golevka/emacs-clang-complete-async/raw/master/screenshots/showcase.png]]

This extension is not implemented in pure elisp, it is made up of a client part
(auto-complete-clang-async.el, written in elisp) and a server part
(clang-complete binary, written in C), they work cooperately in asynchonous
client-server fashion.


* Experimental Feature - On the fly syntax checking

An experimental feature is added to this branch --- running
=ac-clang-syntax-check= to highlight errornous lines in your souce code.

* Experimental Feature - Jump to declaration and definition

You can now jump to either the declaration or the definition of the
element your cursor is on.

To jump to the definition, use =ac-clang-jump-definition=.

To jump to the declaration, use =ac-clang-jump-declaration=.

To jump to the definition, if it's available, otherwise to the declaration, use =ac-clang-jump-smart=.

To pop the jump stack and go back to a previous location, use =ac-clang-jump-back=.

* Setup

Compile the server part (clang-complete binary) first, by executing
=make=. The build process uses =llvm-config= to determine the location of
libclang and the appropriate compile flags to use. If =llvm-config= is not in
your path or has a different name, you can pass =make= an =LLVM_CONFIG=
argument, e.g.  =make LLVM_CONFIG=llvm-config-3.4=.

Copy auto-complete-clang-async.el and the previously compiled
clang-complete executable to ~/.emacs.d/, and add the following code to your
.emacs file.

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(require 'auto-complete-clang-async)

(defun ac-cc-mode-setup ()
  (setq ac-clang-complete-executable "~/.emacs.d/clang-complete")
  (setq ac-sources '(ac-source-clang-async))
  (ac-clang-launch-completion-process)

  ;; Optional keybindings
  (define-key ac-mode-map (kbd "M-.") 'ac-clang-jump-smart)
  (define-key ac-mode-map (kbd "M-,") 'ac-clang-jump-back)
  (define-key ac-mode-map (kbd "C-c `") 'ac-clang-syntax-check))

(defun my-ac-config ()
  (add-hook 'c-mode-common-hook 'ac-cc-mode-setup)
  (add-hook 'auto-complete-mode-hook 'ac-common-setup)
  (global-auto-complete-mode t))

(my-ac-config)
#+END_SRC

Now emacs-clang-complete-async will show completion candidates automatically
when you type as usual in C or C++ mode.


* Usage

This extension fades in emacs C/C++ mode and provides candidates
automatically while you typing code, if you want to add parameters to clang
(libclang, actually), such as -Ipath, just call ac-clang-set-cflags
interactively or set the value of ac-clang-flags in .emacs or .dir-locals.el,
maybe you need an explicit call to ac-clang-update-cmdlineargs to make changes 
to cflags take effect, which is a niggling part of it T T


* Note

Most code of auto-complete-clang-async.el is taken from brainjcj's
auto-complete-clang.el, The only difference between this one and bj's
ac-clang-complete is: This one interacts with a process geared with libclang to
retrieve completion candidates instead of calling clang process, which is way
slower, and the asynchonous nature of our C-S based working model won't block
the editor while parsing source code and resolving completion candidates,
which provides a "smooth" coding experience.
